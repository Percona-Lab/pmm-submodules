# PMM Submodules

This repository serves the purpose of creating and/or updating the feature builds for PMM Server and PMM Client. It is auxiliary
to our build system managed by Jenkins as it helps pull the right branches from different repositories that PMM [consists of](https://github.com/percona/pmm).

## How to create a feature build

To create a feature build (FB) you have to edit `ci.yml` and specify the branches that you want the system to pull when building a feature. For example:

```yaml
deps:
  - name: pmm-server
    branch: PMM-0000-fix-everything
  - name: pmm-agent
    branch: PMM-0000-fix-everything-and-even-more
```

To build from a fork, you need to specify `url` for the dependency, for example:

```yaml
deps:
  - name: pmm-server
    url: https://github.com/<your-account>/pmm-server
    branch: PMM-0000-fix-everything
```


Next, you will commit changes to git and push them to the repo:

```
git add ci.yml
git commit -m 'use custom branches'
git push
```

## Using a Personal Access Token (PAT)

Given that github is limiting the number of API requests for unauthenticated users, it'd be a good idea to use your personal access token. You can create a personal token in [Github settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Generate New Token -> Click on a repo -> Create an environment variable called GITHUB_TOKEN and provide your token as the value.

if you use zsh:

```console
echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN=********' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

if you use bash:

```console
echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN=********' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

NOTE: Please make sure you don't commit your PAT to github. Should the PAT accidentally leak out, please revoke it asap and re-create it.

## FAQ

### What if my FB is made up of branches with the same name?

If you use the same branch name in all repos then you can run:

```console
make prepare <you branch name>
```

Branches with "you branch name" will be used for all repos or default branch if the branch with this name isn't found in repo.

### What's a `global` repo in ci.yml?

It's a branch name that this script will try to find in a repo instead of the default branch (usually called `main` or `PMM-2.0`).

### Can I build my FB as before using .gitmodules?

Certainly. If `ci.yml` is left empty, the system will pick the branches from `.gitmodules` as before. The mix of both however is not supported.
