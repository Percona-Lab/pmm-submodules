# Bar gauge panel

The bar gauge simplifies your data by reducing every field to a single value. You choose how Grafana calculates the reduction.

This panel can show one or more bar gauges depending on how many series, rows, or columns your query returns.

## Data and field options

Bar gauge visualizations allow you to apply:

- [Data transformations]({{< relref "../transformations/_index.md" >}})
- [Field options and overrides]({{< relref "../field-options/_index.md" >}})
- [Thresholds]({{< relref "../thresholds.md" >}})

## Display options

Use the following options to refine your visualization:

- **Show -** Choose how Grafana displays your data.
  - **Calculate -** Show a calculated value based on all rows. For a list of available calculations, refer to [List of calculations]({{< relref "../calculations-list.md" >}}).
  - **All values -** Show a separate stat for every row. If you select this option, then you can also select a **Limit**, or the maximum number of rows to display.
- **Value -** Select a reducer function that Grafana will use to reduce many fields to a single value. Click the **Value** list to see functions and brief descriptions.
- **Orientation -** Choose a stacking direction.
  - **Auto -** Grafana selects what it thinks is the best orientation.
  - **Horizontal -** Bars stretch horizontally, left to right.
  - **Vertical -** Bars stretch vertically, top to bottom.
- **Display mode -** Choose a display mode.
  - **Gradient -** Threshold levels define a gradient.
  - **Retro LCD -** The gauge is split into small cells that are lit or unlit.
  - **Basic -** Single color based on the matching threshold.
- **Show unfilled area -** Select this if you want to render the unfilled region of the bars as dark gray. Not applicable to Retro LCD display mode.
