# Getting started

This guide will help you get started and acquainted with Grafana. To learn more about Grafana in general, refer to [What is Grafana?]({{< relref "what-is-grafana.md" >}}).

## Install Grafana

This step varies according to your computer operating system. Refer to the instructions for your OS in the [Installation]({{< relref "../installation/_index.md" >}}) section for instructions.

## Log in for the first time 

1. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000/. `3000` is the default HTTP port that Grafana listens to if you havenâ€™t configured a different port.
1. On the login page, type `admin` for the username and password.
1. Change your password. 

> **Note:** We strongly encourage you to follow Grafana best practices and change the default administrator password. Don't forget to record your credentials!

## Create a dashboard

1. Click **New dashboard**.
1. Click **Add Query**. Grafana creates a basic graph panel with the Random Walk scenario.
1. Save your dashboard. Click the **Save dashboard** icon in the top corner of the screen.

 Congratulations, you have gotten started with Grafana! You have a dashboard and are displaying results. Feel free to experiment with what you have built, continue on to add another data source, or explore [Next steps](#next-steps).
