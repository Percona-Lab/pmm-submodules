# GitLab OAuth2 Authentication

To enable GitLab OAuth2 you must register the application in GitLab. GitLab will generate a client ID and secret key for you to use.

## Create GitLab OAuth keys

You need to [create a GitLab OAuth application](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/integration/oauth_provider.html).
Choose a descriptive *Name*, and use the following *Redirect URI*:

```
https://grafana.example.com/login/gitlab
```

where `https://grafana.example.com` is the URL you use to connect to Grafana.
Adjust it as needed if you don't use HTTPS or if you use a different port; for
instance, if you access Grafana at `http://203.0.113.31:3000`, you should use

```
http://203.0.113.31:3000/login/gitlab
```

Finally, select *read_api* as the *Scope* and submit the form. Note that if you're
not going to use GitLab groups for authorization (i.e. not setting
`allowed_groups`, see below), you can select *read_user* instead of *read_api* as
the *Scope*, thus giving a more restricted access to your GitLab API.

You'll get an *Application Id* and a *Secret* in return; we'll call them
`GITLAB_APPLICATION_ID` and `GITLAB_SECRET` respectively for the rest of this
section.

## Enable GitLab in Grafana

Add the following to your Grafana configuration file to enable GitLab
authentication:

```bash
[auth.gitlab]
enabled = true
allow_sign_up = false
client_id = GITLAB_APPLICATION_ID
client_secret = GITLAB_SECRET
scopes = read_api
auth_url = https://gitlab.com/oauth/authorize
token_url = https://gitlab.com/oauth/token
api_url = https://gitlab.com/api/v4
allowed_groups =
```

You may have to set the `root_url` option of `[server]` for the callback URL to be 
correct. For example in case you are serving Grafana behind a proxy.

Restart the Grafana backend for your changes to take effect.

If you use your own instance of GitLab instead of `gitlab.com`, adjust
`auth_url`, `token_url` and `api_url` accordingly by replacing the `gitlab.com`
hostname with your own.

With `allow_sign_up` set to `false`, only existing users will be able to login
using their GitLab account, but with `allow_sign_up` set to `true`, *any* user
who can authenticate on GitLab will be able to login on your Grafana instance;
if you use the public `gitlab.com`, it means anyone in the world would be able
to login on your Grafana instance.

You can limit access to only members of a given group or list of
groups by setting the `allowed_groups` option.

### allowed_groups

To limit access to authenticated users that are members of one or more [GitLab
groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/group/index.html), set `allowed_groups`
to a comma- or space-separated list of groups. For instance, if you want to
only give access to members of the `example` group, set


```ini
allowed_groups = example
```

If you want to also give access to members of the subgroup `bar`, which is in
the group `foo`, set

```ini
allowed_groups = example, foo/bar
```

Note that in GitLab, the group or subgroup name doesn't always match its
display name, especially if the display name contains spaces or special
characters. Make sure you always use the group or subgroup name as it appears
in the URL of the group or subgroup.

Here's a complete example with `allow_sign_up` enabled, and access limited to
the `example` and `foo/bar` groups:

```ini
[auth.gitlab]
enabled = true
allow_sign_up = true
client_id = GITLAB_APPLICATION_ID
client_secret = GITLAB_SECRET
scopes = api
auth_url = https://gitlab.com/oauth/authorize
token_url = https://gitlab.com/oauth/token
api_url = https://gitlab.com/api/v4
allowed_groups = example, foo/bar
```

### Team Sync (Enterprise only)

> Only available in Grafana Enterprise v6.4+

With Team Sync you can map your GitLab groups to teams in Grafana so that your users will automatically be added to
the correct teams. 

Your GitLab groups can be referenced in the same way as `allowed_groups`, like `example` or `foo/bar`.
